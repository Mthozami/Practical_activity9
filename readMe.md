This project is a python based project where we are dealing with algorithms.so in this project I used a bubble sort algorithm and insertion sort algorithms to sort a list of numbers. secondly I used a binary search algorithm to search a specific number at the specific index in that list again and used a heap sort algorithm to show iterations during the heap sorting, Also i explained a linear search algorithm that what is that and how it works.  

well done my boy
